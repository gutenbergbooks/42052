        <span>Where, canopied by hovering, white wings,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They crowded naked pinnacles of rock.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He watched, with eyes of glistening tenderness,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The brooding eider--Cuthbert's sacred bird,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That bears among the isles his saintly name--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Breast the calm waves; a black, wet-gleaming fin</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Cleft the blue waters with a foaming jag,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Where, close behind the restless herring-herd,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With ravening maw of death, the porpoise sped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Oswald, light-tranced, dreamed in the sun awhile;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till, suddenly, as some old sorrow starts,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though years have glided by with soothing lull,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The gust of ancient longing rent his bliss:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His narrow isle, as by some darkling spell,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>More narrow shrank; the gulls' unceasing cries</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Grew still more fretful; and his hermit-life</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A sea-scourged desolation to him seemed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The holy tree of peace--which he had dreamt</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Would flourish in the wilderness afresh,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upspringing ever in new ecstasy</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of branching beauty and white blooms of truth,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till its star-tangling crest should cleave the sky,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And angels rustle through its topmost boughs--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Seemed sapless, rootless. Through his quivering limbs</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His famine-wasted youth to life upleapt</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With passionate yearning for humanity:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The stir of towns; the jostling of glad throngs;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Welcoming faces and warm-clasping hands;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yea, even for the lips and eyes of Love</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He hungered with keen pangs of old desire:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, if for him these might not be, he craved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>At least the exultation of swift peril--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The red-foamed riot of delirious strife</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That rears a bloody crest o'er peaceful shires,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, slaying, in a swirl of slaughter dies.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With brow uplifted and strained, pulsing throat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And salt-parched lips out-thrust, unto the sun</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He stretched beseeching hands, as though he sought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To snatch some glittering disaster thence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>One moment radiant thus; and then once more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His arms dropped listless, and he slowly shrank</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within his sea-stained habit, cowering dark</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Amid the azure blaze of sea and sky.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, stirring, with impatient step he moved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Across the isle to where the rocky shore,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Forming a little, crag-encircled bay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sloped steeply to the level of the sea;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, as he neared the edges of the tide,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Startled, he paused, as, marvelling, he saw</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A woman on the shelving, wet, black rock,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Lying, forlorn, among the storm-wrack, white</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And motionless; still wet, her raiment clung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>About her limbs, and with her wet, gold hair</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Green sea-weed tangled. Oswald on her looked</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Amazed, as one who, in a sea-born trance,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Discovers the lone spirit of the storm,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Self-spent at last, and sunk in dreamless slumber</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within some caverned gloom. Coldly he watched</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The little waves creep up the glistening rock,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, faltering, slide once more into the deep,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though they feared to waken her: at length,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When one, more venturous, about her stole,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And moved her heavy hair as if with life,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He shuddered; and a lightning-knowledge struck</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His heart with fear; and in a flash he knew</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That no sea-phantom couched before him lay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But some frail fellow-creature, tempest-tost,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Hung yet in peril on the edge of death,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her weak life slipping from the saving grasp</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While he delayed. He sprang through plashy weed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>O'er slippery ridges, to the rock whereon</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She lay with upturned face and close-shut eyes--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>One hand across her breast, the other dipped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within a shallow pool of emerald water,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With blue-veined fingers clutching the red fronds</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of frail sea-weed. Then Oswald, bending, felt</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon his cheek the feeble breath that still</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Fluttered between the pallid, parted lips.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In trembling haste, he loosed the sodden cords</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That bound her to a spar; and with hot hands</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He chafed her icy limbs, until the glow</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of life returned. With fitful quivering</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The white lids opened; and she looked on him</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With dull, unwondering eyes whose deep-sea blue</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The gloom of death's late passing shadowed yet;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When suddenly light thrilled them, and bright fear</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flashed from their depths, and, with a little gasp,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She strove to rise; but Oswald with quick words</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Calmed her weak terror, and she sank once more,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Closing her eyes; and, gently lifting her</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within his arms--her gold hair hanging straight</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And heavy with sea-water, as he plunged</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Knee-deep through pools of crackling bladder-weed--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He bore her, unresisting, o'er the isle</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unto the rock-built shelter he had reared,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Some little way apart from his own cell,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For storm-stayed fishers or wrecked mariners.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He laid her on a bed of withered bents,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And ministered to her with gentle hands</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And ceaseless care; till, wrapped in warm, deep sleep,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She sank oblivious. Silently he placed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His island-fare beside her on the board,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Lest she should wake in need; then, with hushed step,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He turned to go; but, ere he reached the door,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He paused, and looked again towards the bed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though he feared his strange sea-guest might flee</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Like some wild spirit, born of wondering foam,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That wins from man the shelter of his breast,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, on a night of moon-enchanted tides,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Leaps with shrill laughter to its native seas,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Bearing his soul within its glistening arms,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To drown his peace on earth and hope of heaven</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In cold eternities of lightless deeps.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But still in dreamless sleep the stranger lay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With parted lips and breathing soft and calm;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>About her head unloosed, her hair outshone,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Among the grey-green bents, like fine, red gold.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>So beautiful she was that Oswald, pierced</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With quivering rapture, dared no longer bide,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, with quick fingers, softly raised the latch,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And stumbled o'er the threshold. As he went,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A flock of sea-gulls from the bent-thatched roof</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Rose, querulous, and round him, wheeling, swept,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With creaking wings and cold, black eyes agleam;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet Oswald saw them not, nor heard their cries;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Nor saw he, as he paced the eastern crags,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How, round the Farnes, the dreaming ocean lay</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In broad, unshadowed, sapphire ecstasy,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That glowed to noon through slow, uncounted hours.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His early gloom had vanished; time and space</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And earth and sea no longer compassed him;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>One thought alone consumed him--beauty slept</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the shelter of his hermitage,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon grey, rustling bents, with golden hair.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He roamed, unresting, till the copper sun</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sank in a steel-grey sea, and earth and sky</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Were strewn with shadows--wavering and dim--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To weave a pathway for the dawning moon,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That she, from night's oblivion, might create</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With the cold spell of her enchantments old</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A phantom earth with magical, bright seas,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A vaster heaven of unrevealed stars.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unmoving, on a headland of swart crag</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That jutted gaunt and sharp against the night,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Stood Oswald, cowled and silent. Hour by hour</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He gazed across the sea, which nothing shadowed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Save where--now dim, now white--a lonely sail</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Hung, restless, o'er a fisher's barren toil.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet Oswald saw nor sail nor moon nor sea:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His heart kept vigil by the little house</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Wherein the stranger slumbered; and it seemed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His life, by some strange power within him stayed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Awaited the unlatching of the door.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>But now, within the hut, the sleeper dreamt</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of foaming caverns and o'erwhelming waters;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, shuddering awake, awhile she lay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And watched the moonlight, cold and white, which poured</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Through the warm dusk, from the high window-slit;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When, all at once, the strangeness of the room</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Closed in upon her with bewildering dread.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She stirred; the bents, beneath her, rustled strange;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She started in affright, and, swaying, stood</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the streaming moonlight, till, at last,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In memory, once more disaster swept</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Over her life, and left her, desolate,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon bleak crags of alien seas unknown.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet, through the tumult of tempestuous dark,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Above the echo of despairing cries,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A calm voice sounded; and beyond the whirl</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of foaming death, wherein she caught the gleam</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of well-loved faces drowning in cold seas,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A living face shone out--a beacon clear:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then numbing fear fell from her, and she moved,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unlatched the door, and stole into the night.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>One moment, dazzled by the full-moon glare,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She paused, a shivering form within the wide</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And glittering desolation--lone and frail.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But Oswald, watchful on the eastern scars,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Seeing her, forward came with eager pace</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To meet her; and, as he drew swiftly near,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His cowl fell backward; and she knew again</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The face that calmed the terrors of her dreams.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet, with the knowledge, through her being stole,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Vague fear more strange, more impotent than the blind</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unquestioning dread when death had round her stormed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>No peril of the body could arouse</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Such ecstasy of terror in her soul,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Which seemed upborne upon the shivering crest</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of some great wave, just curving, ere it crash</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon the crags of time. Yet, though she feared</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When Oswald paused, uncertain, quick she spake,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though she sought to parry doom with words.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She questioned him--scarce heeding his replies--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How she had hither come; when, suddenly,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sped by her fluttering words, the last, dim cloud</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Rolled from her memory, and she saw revealed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within a pitiless glare of naked light</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The utmost horror of her desolation.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Mute with despair, she stood with parted lips,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And then cried fiercely: "Hath the sea upcast</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>None other on this shore? Am I, alone,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of all my kin who sailed in that doomed ship,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flung back to life?" And as, with piteous glance,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He answered her: "Ah God, that I, with them,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Had died! O traitor cords that held too sure</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>My body to the broken spar of life!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>O feeble seas, that fumed in such wild wrath,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet could not quench so frail a thing as I!"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With passionate step, across the isle she ran,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And leapt from crag to crag, until she stood</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon a dizzy scar that jutted sheer</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Above low-lapping waves. Then once again</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her moaning cry was heard among the Isles:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"O bitter waters, give them back to me!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>You shall not keep them; all your waves of woe</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Cannot withhold from me those dauntless lives</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That were my life. Surely they cannot rest</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Without me; even from your unfathomed graves</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Surely my love will draw them to my arms!"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though in tremulous expectation tranced,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She yearned, with arms outstretched; as dawn arose</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Exultant from the sea, and with clear rays</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Kindled her wind-tost hair to streaming flame.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>Awhile she stood, then, moaning, slowly sank</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon the crag; and Oswald came to her</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With words of comfort which unloosed her pent</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And aching woe in swift, tumultuous tears.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Oswald, in silent anguish, drew apart,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Gazing, unseeing, o'er the dawning waves;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Until at last the tempest of her grief,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In low and fitful sobbing, spent itself;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When, turning to him, once again she spake,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, shuddering, with faltering voice, outpoured</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The tale of her despair: and Oswald heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How she, who sat thus strangely by his side,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Marna, a sea-earl's daughter, had besought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her father, when the old sea-hunger lit</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His eyes--as waves shot through with stormy fight--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For leave to bear him company but once,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When, with his sons, he rode the adventurous seas;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How he had yielded with reluctant love;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And how, from out the firth of some far strand,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Their galley rode, beneath a flaming dawn;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How her young heart had leapt to see the sails</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unfurled to take the wind, as, one by one,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Toil-glistening rowers shipped the dripping oars,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And loosened every sheet before the breeze;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How, as the ship with timbers all astrain,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Leapt to mid-sea, through Marna's body thrilled</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A kindred rapture, and there came to her</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The sheer, delirious joy of them true-born</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To wander with the foam--each creaking cord</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That tugged the quivering mast unto her singing</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of unknown shores and far, enchanted lands,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Beyond the blue horizon; how, all day,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They rode, undaunted, through the spinning surf;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, as the sun dipped, in the cold, grey tide,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The wind, that since the dawn with steady speed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Had filled the sails, now came in fitful gusts,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Fierce and yet fiercer, till the sullen waves</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Were lashed to anger, and the waters leapt</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To tussle with the furies of the air;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And how the ship, in the encounter caught,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Was tossed on crests of swirling dark, or dropped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Between o'er-toppling walls of whelming night;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>How in those hours--too dread for thought or speech--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her father's hand had bound her to a spar;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, even as--the cord between his teeth--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He tugged the last knot sure, the vessel crashed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon a cleaving scar; and she but saw</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The strong, pale faces looking upon death,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before the fierce, exultant waters closed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With cold oblivion o'er them; and no more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She knew, until she waked within the hut,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To find her world, in one disastrous night,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In one swift surge of roaring darkness, swept</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From her young feet; her kindred, home and friends,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And all familiar hopes and joys and fears</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Dropt like a garment from her life, which now</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Stood naked on the edge of some new world</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of unknown terrors.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="inner line-block">
        <div class="inner line-block">
          <div class="line">
            <span>Oswald heard her tale</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With pitying glance; yet in his eyes arose</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A strange, new light, which as each gust of grief</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Shook out the fluttering words, more brightly burned;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>So that, when Marna ceased, it seemed to her</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That he, in holy contemplation rapt,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Had heeded not her woe; and from her heart</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Burst out a cry: "Ah God, I am alone!"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, stung by her shrill anguish, Oswald waked</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From his bright reverie, and his shining eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Darkened with swift compassion, as he turned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, trembling, spake: "Nay, not alone..."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="inner line-block">
        <div class="line">
          <span>Then mute</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He stood--his pale lips clenched--as though within</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>There surged a torrent which he dared not loose.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Marna looked wondering up; but, when her eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Saw the white passion of his face, her soul</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Was tossed once more on crests of unknown fears;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet rapture warred with terror in her heart;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She trembled, and her breath came short and quick.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She dared not raise her eyes again to his,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till, on her straining ears, his words, once more,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Fell, slow and cold and clear as water dripping</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Between locked sluice-gates: "Nothing need you fear.</span>
      </div>

        <span>Beyond the sea of unknown terrors lie</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>White havens of an undiscovered peace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For even this bleak, scar-embattled coast</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>May yield safe harbour to the storm-spent soul.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Your world has fallen from you that you may</span>

        <span>Built 'neath the shadow of the throne of God.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>There shall you find new friends, who yet will seem</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Familiar to your eyes, because their souls</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Have passed through kindred perils and despairs."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He ceased; and silence, trembling, 'twixt them hung;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till Marna, gazing yet across the sea,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Rent it with words: "Where may I find this peace?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And Oswald answered: "In an inland dale</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The Sisters of the Cross await your coming,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With ever-open gate. Within seven days,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>My brethren from the mainland will put out,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Bringing me food; on their return with them</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>You may embark. Till then, this barren rock</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Must be your home." Exultant light once more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Leapt, flashing, in the depths of his dark eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet Marna looked not up, but, slowly, spake:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"Yea, I must go.... But you...."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="inner line-block">
        <div class="line">
          <span>Then in dismay</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She stopped, as though the thought had slipped unknown</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From her full heart; but Oswald caught the words,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And spake with hard, quick speech, as if to baffle</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Some doubt that strove within him: "On this Isle</span>
      </div>

        <span>I bide, till God shall kindle my weak soul</span>
      </div>

        <span>To burn, a beacon o'er His lonely seas."</span>
      </div>

        <span>Once more he paused; and perilous silence swayed</span>

        <span>Between them, until Oswald, quaking, rose,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As one who dared no longer rest beneath</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>O'er-toppling doom. Yet, with calm voice, he spake:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"Even within this wilderness abides</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Such beauty that, in your brief sojourn here,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Your soul shall starve not; all about you sweeps</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The ever-changing wonder of the sea;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But if, too full of bitter memories,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The bright waves darken, you may lift your eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To watch the swooping gull; the flashing tern;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The stately cormorant and the kittiwake--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Most beautiful of all the island-birds;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Or, if your woman's heart should crave some grace</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>More exquisite, see, frail bell-campions blow,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As foam-flowers on the shallow, sandy turf."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As thus he spake, a light in Marna's eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Arose, and sorrow left her for awhile:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And she with bright glance questioned him, and watched</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The hovering gulls, and plucked the snowy blooms,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With little cries at each discovered beauty.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet Oswald by her side walked silently,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And watched, as one struck mute with anguished fear,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her eager eyes, and heard her chattering words.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, suddenly, he left her, but returned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the hour, with faltering step, and spake</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With tremulous voice: "We two must part awhile;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For I must keep lone vigil in my cell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Six days and nights, with fasting and with prayer;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Meanwhile, within the little hut for you</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Are food and shelter till the brethren come.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When I must give you over to their care."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Marna, with wondering heart, looked up at him;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But such a wild light flickered in his eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She dared not speak; and, shuddering, he turned,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And strode back swiftly to the hermitage.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>Marna looked after him with yearning gaze,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though her heart would have her call him back,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet her lips moved not; motionless, she watched</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Until he passed from sight; then, sinking low</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Among the flowers, she wept, she knew not why.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, as the door closed on him, Oswald fell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Prone on the cold, black, vigil-furrowed rock</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That paved his narrow cell; and long he lay</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As in the clutch of some dread waking-trance,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Nor stirred until the shadows into night</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Were woven. Then unto his feet he leapt</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With this wild cry: "O God, why hast Thou sent</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>This scourge most bitter for my naked soul?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I feared not storm nor solitude, O God;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I shrank not from the tempest of Thy wrath;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though oft my weak soul wavered, trampled o'er</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>By deedless hours, and yearned unto the world,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Ever afresh Thy love hath bound me fast</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unto this island of Thy lonely seas;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And I, who deemed that I at last might reach--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I who had come through all--Thy golden haven,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Knew not Thy hand withheld this last despair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>This scourge most bitter, being most beautiful."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then on his knees he sank, and tried to pray</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before the Virgin's shrine, where ever burned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His votive taper with unfailing light.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But when his lips would breathe the holy name,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His heart cried: "Marna! Marna!" Every pulse</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Throbbed "Marna!" And his body shook and swayed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though it strove to utter that one word,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And cry it once unto eternal stars,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though it should perish crying. Through the cell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The silence murmured: "Marna!" And without</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A lone gull wailed it to the windy night.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He lifted his wild eyes, and in the shrine</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He saw the face of Marna, which outburned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The flickering taper; on the gloom up-surged,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Foam-white, the face of Marna; till the dark</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flowed pitiful o'er him, and on the stone</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He sank unconscious. Night went slowly by,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And pale dawn stole in silence through his cell;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, in the light of morn, the taper died,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With feeble guttering; yet he never stirred,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though noonday waxed and waned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="inner line-block">
        <div class="line">
          <span>But Marna roamed</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>All night beneath the stars. To her it seemed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That not until the closing of the door</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Had all hope perished: now death tore, afresh,</span>
      </div>

        <span>Her father and her brothers from her arms.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>By day and night and under sun and moon</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She roamed unresting--seeing, heeding naught--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till weariness o'ercame her, and she slept;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, as she slumbered, snowy-plumed peace</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Nestled within her heart; and, when she waked,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She only yearned for that dim, cloistral calm,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Embosomed deep in some bough-sheltered vale,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Whither the boat must bear her.</span>

        <div class="inner line-block">
          <div class="line">

        <span>As night paled slowly to the seventh morn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Oswald arose--the fire within his eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet more intense, more fierce. With eager hand</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He clutched the latch, and, flinging wide the door,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He strode into the dawn. One moment, dazed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As though bewildered by the light, he paused;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, when his glance in restless roving fell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>On Marna, standing on the western crag</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Against the setting moon, beneath the dawn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His passion surged upon him, and he shook;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, springing madly forth, he, stumbling, ran,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, falling at her feet upon the rock,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His voice rang out in fearful exultation:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"You shall not go! I cannot let you go!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Has not the tumult tossed you to my breast?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yea, and not all the storms of all the seas</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Shall drag you from me! Nay, you shall not go!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For we will live together on this isle</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Which time has builded in the deeps for us--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>We two together, one in ecstasy,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Throughout eternity; for time shall fall</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From off us; and the world shall be no more:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And God, if God should stand between us now..."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Faltering, he paused; and Marna stood, afraid,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Quaking before him; but she spake no word.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Across the waters came the plash of oars;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But Oswald heard them not, and once more cried:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"You will not go--thrusting me back to death?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For now I know the strange, new thing you brought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For me from out the storm was life--yea, life;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And I am one arisen from the grave.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>You will not thrust me back and take again</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That which you came through storm to bring to me?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>You will not go? I cannot let you go!"</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>He ceased; and now the even plash of oars</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Came clearer. One dread moment Marna stood</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Swaying; then, stretching forth her arms, she cried:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"Ah God! Ah God! Why hath Thy cold hand set</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>This doom upon me? Must I ever bear</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Death and disaster unto whom I love?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Oh, is it not enough that, 'neath the wave,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Because I sought to bear them company,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>My father and my brothers lie in death?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But this--ah God--that it should come to this!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Must I bear ever death within my hands?"</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>She paused one moment, with wild-heaving breast;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, turning unto Oswald, spake again,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With softer voice: "But you--have you no pity?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>You who are but God's servant--surely you</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Have pity on my weakness. From this doom</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Which overhangs me you must set me free.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>You say I brought you life; but in me lies</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For you--the priest of God--a death more deep</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Than all the drowning fathoms of the sea.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I go, that you may live. If life indeed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I brought you, I was but the torch of God</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To kindle the clear flame of your strong soul</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To burn, a beacon o'er His lonely seas."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She ceased, with arms outstretched and lighted eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As on some holy vision Oswald gazed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In rapt, adoring fear; nor spake, nor stirred.</span>
      </div>

        <span>Near, and yet nearer, drew the plash of oars;</span>

        <span>And, turning in the boat, the brethren looked</span>
      </div>

      <div class="line">
        <span>A vigil-wearied squire before the throne.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>He paused one moment while the people turned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To look on him with eyes that kindled bright,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Seeing his face aglow with strange, new light;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet them he saw not where they watched amazed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, though like azure flames Queen Hild's eyes burned,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Beyond the shadow of the throne he gazed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To where, in kindred rapture, young Christine</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Stood, tremulous and white, in wind-flower grace--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Beneath her thick, dark hair, her happy face</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Pale-gleaming 'midst the ruddy maiden-throng;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, following Geoffrey's eyes, the trembling Queen</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Now bade the harpers rouse the air with song:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From pulsing throat and silver-throbbing string</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The music soared, light-winged, and, fluttering, fell;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When, startled as one waking from a spell,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Geoffrey stepped back among the waiting knights;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While knelt another squire before the King.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In Queen Hild's eyes yet hovered stormy lights,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Beneath her glooming brows, as waters gleam</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Under snow-laden skies; the summer day</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For her in that brief glance had shivered grey,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Empty of light and song. She only heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The King and knights as people of a dream;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet keenly Geoffrey's lightest, laughing word</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Stung to the quick, and stabbed her quivering life,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till from each shuddering wound the red joy flowed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, though a ruddy fire on each cheek glowed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She felt her drainèd heart within her cold;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then all at once a hot thought stirred new strife</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within her breast, and suddenly grown old</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And wise in treacherous imagining,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She pressed her thin lips to a bitter smile,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And strove with laughing mask to hide the guile</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That, slowly welling, through her body poured</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Cold-blooded life that feels no arrowy sting</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of joy or hope, nor thrust of pity's sword.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To Christine, where she yet enraptured stood,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Hild, turning, spake kind words, and coldly praised</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The new-made knight. Each word Christine amazed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Drank in with joyous heart and eager ears;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To her it seemed ne'er lived a Queen so good;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And love's swift rapture filled her eyes with tears.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For her true heart, the day-long pageant moved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Round Geoffrey's shining presence; king and knight</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But shone for her with pale, reflected light.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As trancèd planets circling round the sun,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>About the radiant head of her beloved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The dim throngs moved until the day was done.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When lucent gold suffused the cloudless west,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And lingering thrush-notes failed in drowsy song,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She left, at last, the weary maiden-throng,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To stray alone through dew-hung garden-glades;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And all the love unsealed within her breast</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flowed out from her to light the darkest shades.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her quivering maiden-body could not hold</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The sudden welling of love's loosened flood;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Through all her limbs it gushed, and in her blood</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>It stormed each throbbing pulse with blissful ache;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>It seemed to spray the utmost glooms with gold,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And scatter glistening dews in every brake.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While yet she moved in rapture unafraid</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Among the lilies, down the Grey Nun's Walk,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She heard behind the snapping of a stalk,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And stayed transfixed, nor dared to turn her head,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But stood a solitary, trembling maid--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Forlorn and frail, with all her courage fled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Thus Geoffrey found her as, hot-foot, he pressed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To pour about her all the glowing tide</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Day-pent within his heart; the flood-gates wide,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His love swept over her, sea after sea,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Until life almost swooned within her breast,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And she seemed like to drown in ecstasy.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet, as the tempest sank in calm at last,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She rose from out the foam of love, new-born--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As Venus from the irised surf of morn--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To such triumphant beauty, Geoffrey, thralled,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before her stood in wonder rooted fast;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Even his love within him bowed appalled</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In tongueless worship as he gazed on her;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While, lily-like, the trancèd flowers among,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She stood, love-radiant, and above her hung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The canopy of star-enkindling night;</span>
      </div>

      <div class="line">
        <span>That wandered there so late? Yea, now I know,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine, because you flush and tremble so.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet look you not on me with eyes that burn;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I would not stay you when you go to greet</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The rider of the dawn on his return.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Think you I leave my bed at break of day--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I, Hild the Queen--to thwart a lover's kiss?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Think you my love of you could stoop to this,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though you would wed a fledgling, deedless Knight?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Nay, shrink you not from me, turn not away;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Because my heart has never known love's light,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>I fain would hear your happy tale of love,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That I may prosper you and your fair youth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Will you not trust me?" Blind with love's glad truth,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine sank down within Hild's outstretched arms.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Speechless, awhile, with sobbing breath she strove;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then poured out all the tale of love's alarms,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Raptures, despairs, and deathless ecstasies,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In one quick torrent from her brimming heart;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, quaking, ceased, and drew herself apart,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Dismayed that she so easily had revealed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To this white, cold-eyed Queen love's sanctities.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet Hild moved not, but stood, with hard lips sealed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Until, the chiming of the turret-bell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Recalling her, she spake with far-off voice:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"I, loveless, in your innocent love rejoice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>May nothing stem its eager raptured course!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Oh, that my barren heart could love so well,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And feel the surge of love's subduing force!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet even I from out my dearth may give</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To you, Christine. Would you that Geoffrey's name</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Shall shine, unchallenged, on the lists of fame?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>If you would have him win for you the crown</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of knightly immortality, and live</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Triumphant on men's tongues in high renown,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Follow me now." With cold, exulting eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She raised the arras, opening to the light</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>An unknown stair-way clambering into night.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the caverned wall she swiftly passed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine for one brief moment in surprise</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Uncertain paused; then, wondering, followed fast.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The falling arras shutting out the day,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She stumbled blindly through the soaring gloom--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Enclosing dank and chilly as the tomb</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her panting life; and unto her it seemed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That ever, as she climbed, more sheer the way</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before her rose, and ever fainter gleamed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The wan, white star of light that overhead</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Hovered remote. Far up the stair she heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A silken rustling as, without a word,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Relentlessly Queen Hild before her sped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For ever up the ever-soaring steep.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But when it almost seemed that she must fall--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>So loudly in her ears the pulses beat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And each step seemed to sink beneath her feet--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She heard the shrilly grating of a key,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And saw, above her, in the unseen wall,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A dazzling square of day break suddenly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the lighted doorway Queen Hild turned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To reach a helping hand, and, as she bent</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To clutch the swooning maiden, well-nigh spent,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And drew her to the chamber, weak and faint,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Through her gold hair so rare a lustre burned,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>It seemed to Christine that an aureoled saint</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Leaned out from heaven to snatch her from the deep.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, dizzily, she sank upon the floor,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Dreaming that toil was over evermore,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And she secure in Love's celestial fold;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till, waking gradually as from a sleep,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her dark eyes opened on a blaze of gold.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She sat within a chamber hung around</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With glistering tapestry, whereon a knight,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Who bore a golden helm above the fight,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For ever triumphed o'er assailing swords,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Or led the greenwood chase with horse and hound,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While far behind him lagged the dames and lords</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And all the hunting train; till he, at length,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Brought low the antlered quarry on the brink</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of some deep, craggy cleft, wherefrom did shrink</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The quailing hounds with lathered flanks aquake.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As Christine looked on them, her maiden-strength</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Returned to her; and now, more broad awake,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She saw, within the centre of the room,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A golden table whereon glittered bright</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A casket of wrought gold, and, in the light,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Queen Hild, awaiting her, with smiling lips,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And laughing words: "Is this then love's sad doom,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To perish, fainting, in light's brief eclipse</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Between a curtain and a closed door?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Shall this bright casket ever hold, unsought,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The golden helm--in elfin-ages wrought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For some star-destined knight--because love's heart</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Grows faint within her? Shall the world no more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Acclaim its helmèd lord?" But, with a start,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine arose, and swiftly forward came</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With eager eyes, and stooped with fluttering breast--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her slender, shapely hands together pressed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In tense expectancy, and all her face</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With quivering light of wondering love aflame.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The Queen bent down, and in a breathing space</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unlocked the casket with a golden key,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And deftly loosed a little golden pin;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The heavy lid swung open and, within,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To Christine's eyes revealed the golden helm.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then spake Queen Hild, once more: "Your love-gift see!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Think you that any smith in all the realm</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Can beat dull metal to so fair a casque?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In jewelled caverns of enchantment old</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>This helm was wrought of magic-tempered gold</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To yieldless strength, by elfin-hammers chased,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That toiled unwearied at their age-long task,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And over it an unknown legend traced</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In letters of some world-forgotten tongue.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>At noon, with careful footing, down the stair</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unto the hall the casket you must bear,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When King and knight are gathered round the board,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, ere the tales be told or songs be sung,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Acclaim your love the golden-helmed lord."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine, awhile, in speechless wonderment,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Hung o'er the glistering helm, and silence fell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the arrased chamber like a spell;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While softly, on some distant, sunlit roof,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The basking pigeons cooed with deep content;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till, far below, a sudden-clanging hoof</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Startled the morn. The women's lifted eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>One moment met in kindred ecstasy;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then Hild, with hopeless shudder, shaking free,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With strained voice spake: "Why do you longer wait?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Your love returns; shall he, in sad surprise,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Find no glad face to greet him at the gate?"</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="vspace" style="height: 2em"></div>
    <p class="center pfirst"><span class="medium">III.</span></p>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>As some new jest was tossed from tongue to tongue,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Light laughter rippled round the midday board,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Beneath the bannered rafters: dame and lord</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And maid and squire with merry chattering</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sat feasting; though no motley humour wrung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A smile from Hild, where she, beside the King,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Watched pale and still. She saw on Geoffrey's face</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Grave wonder that he caught not anywhere</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Among the maids the dusk of Christine's hair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Or sunlight of her glance. His eyes, between</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The curtained doorway and her empty place,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Kept eager, anxious vigil for Christine.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But when, at last, the lingering meal nigh o'er,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The waking harp-notes trembled through the hush,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Like the light, fitful prelude of the thrush</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Ere his full song enchant the domèd elm;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The arras parting, through the open door</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She came. Before her borne, the golden helm</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within the dim-lit hall shone out so bright,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That lord and dame in rustling wonder rose,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And squire and maiden sought to gather close,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With questioning lips, about the love-bright maid.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine, unheeding, turned nor left nor right;</span>

        <span>With lifted head and eager step unstayed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She strode to Geoffrey, while he stood alone,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Radiant with wondering love--as one who sees</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The light of high, eternal mysteries</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">

        <span>From out oblivion unto night unknown,</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>Hugging a little grace of joys and loves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before him now she came and, kneeling, spake,</span>

        <span>With slow, clear-welling voice: "In ages old</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>This helm was wrought from elfin-hammered gold,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For one who, in the after-days, should be</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Supreme above his kind, as, in the brake</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of branching fern, the solitary tree</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That crests the fell-top. Unto you I bring</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The gift of destiny, that, as the sun</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>New-risen of your knighthood, newly-won,</span>
      </div>

        <span>The doomful gift, know this: he who shall dare</span>

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The sheltered haven-raptures of the shore,</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>An aching silence shuddered through the hall;</span>
      </div>

        <span>Caught the far flashing of the helm of gold</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>One moment as it glanced with mocking light;</span>

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The heavy fume of wound-wort that had hung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>All night about the hedgerows--parched with drouth;</span>

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Shook her young body. As night-fallen snow</span>

        <span>Burdens with numb despair young April's green,</span>

        <span>Her sorrow lay upon her; hopes and fears</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Within her slept. As something vaguely seen</span>

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>About her like a dream by doom o'ercast.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Long hours she sat, with silent, folded hands,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And face that glimmered like a winter moon</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In cloudy hair. Across the rain-grey lands</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She gazed with eyes unseeing; till she heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A step within her chamber, and her name</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Fell dully on her ear; then like a flame</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sharp anguish shot through every aching limb</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With keen remembrance. Suddenly she stirred,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, turning, looked on Hild. "Grieve you for him..."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The Queen began; then, with a little gasp,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her voice failed, and she shrank before the gaze</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of Christine's eyes, and, shrivelled by the blaze</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of fires her hand had kindled, all her pride</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Fell shredded, and not even the gold clasp</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of queenhood held, her naked deed to hide.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She quailed, and, turning, fled from out the room.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Soon Christine's wrath was drowned in whelming grief,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And in the fall of tears she found relief--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As brooding skies in sweet release of rain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>All day she wept, until, at length, the gloom</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of eve laid soothing hands upon her pain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, once again, she rose, calm-browed, and sped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Downstairs with silent step, and reached, unstayed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The Grey Nun's Walk, where all alone a maid</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Drank in the rain-cooled air. With low-breathed words,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They whispered long together, while, o'erhead,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From rain-wet branches rang the song of birds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The maiden often paused as in alarm;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, with uncertain, half-delaying pace,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She left Christine, returning in a space</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With Philip, Christine's brother, a young squire,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Who strode by her with careless, swinging arm</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And eager face, with keen, blue eyes afire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then all three stood, with whispering heads bent low,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In eager converse clustered; till, at last,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They parted, and, with high hopes beating fast,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine unto her turret-room returned--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her dark eyes bright and all her face aglow,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As if some new-lit rapture in her burned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>About her little chamber swift she moved,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Until, at length, in travelling array,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She paused to rest, and all-impatient lay</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon her snow-white bed, and watched the light</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Fail from the lilied arras that she loved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Because her hand had wrought each petal white</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And slender, emerald stem. The falling night</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Was lit for her with many a memory</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of little things she could no longer see,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That had been with her in old, happy hours,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before her girlish joys had taken flight</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As morning dews from noon-unfolding flowers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For her, with laggard pace the minutes trailed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Till night seemed to eternity outdrawn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>At last, an hour before the summer-dawn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She rose and once again, with noiseless tread,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Crept down the stair, grey-cloaked and closely veiled,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While every shadow struck her cold with dread</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Lest, drawing back the arras, Hild should stand</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With mocking smile before her; but, unstayed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She reached the stair-foot, and, no more afraid,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She sought a low and shadow-hidden door,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Slid back the silent bolts with eager hand,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And stepped into the garden dim once more.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She quickly crossed a dewy-plashing lawn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, passing through a little wicket-gate,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She reached the road. Not long had she to wait</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Ere, with two bridled horses, Philip came.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Silent they mounted; far they fared ere dawn</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>Burnished the castle-weathercock to flame.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="line">
        <span>Northward they climbed from out the valley mist;</span>

      </div>

        <span>Their weary flight. They sought a lodging-place,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And soon upon a lonely cell they came</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Wherein a hermit laboured after grace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>On beds of withered bracken, soft and warm,</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>Knelt in long vigil on the aching stone,</span>

        <span>Within his little chapel, though, all night,</span>

        <span>His prayers were drowned by thunders of the storm,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And all about him flashed blue, pulsing light.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine in calm, undreaming slumber lay,</span>

        <span>Sang through the forest; though, with roots uptorn,</span>

        <span>The mightiest-limbed and highest-soaring oak</span>
      </div>

      <div class="line">
        <span>At tinkling of the matin-bell she woke,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And soon with Philip left the woodland boughs</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>For barer uplands. Over tawny bent</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>And purpling heath they rode till day was spent;</span>

        <span>When, down within a broad, green-dusking dale,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And dawn's light breaks on bright, embattled spears:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A land whose barren hills are helmed with towers;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A lone, grey land of battle-wasted shires;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A land of blackened barns and empty byres;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A land of rock-bound holds and robber-hordes,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of slumberous noons and wakeful midnight hours,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of ambushed dark and moonlight flashing swords.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With hand on hilt and ever-kindling eyes,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flushed face and quivering nostril, Philip rode;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But nought assailed them; every lone abode</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Forsaken seemed; all empty lay the land</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Beneath the empty sky; only the cries</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of plovers pierced the blue on either hand;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Until, at sudden cresting of a hill,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The clang of battle sounded on their ears,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And, far below, they saw a surge of spears</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Crash on unyielding ranks; while, from the sea</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of striving steel, with deathly singing shrill,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A spray of arrows flickered fitfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Amazed they stood, wide-eyed, with holden breath;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When, of a sudden, flashed upon their sight</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The golden helm in midmost of the fight,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Where, with high-lifted head and undismayed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sir Geoffrey rode, a very lord of death,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With ever-leaping, ever-crashing blade.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine watched long, now cold with quaking dread,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Now hot with hope as each assailant fell;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The bright sword held her gaze as by a spell;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Because love blinded her to all but love,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unmoved she watched the foemen shudder dead,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She whose heart erst the meanest woe could move.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, dazed, she saw a solitary shaft,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unloosed with certain aim from out the bow,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Strike clean through Geoffrey's hauberk, and bring low</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The golden helm, while o'er him swiftly met</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The tides of fight. Christine a little laughed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With rattling throat, and stood with still eyes set.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Scarce Philip dared to raise his eyes to hers</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To see the terror there. No word she spake,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But leaned a little forward through the brake</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>That bloomed about her in a golden blaze;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her hands were torn to bleeding by the furze,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet nothing could disturb that dreadful gaze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then, gradually, the heaving battle swerved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To northward, faltering broken, and afar</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>It closed again, where, round a jutting scar,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The flashing torrent of the river curved.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With eager step Christine ran down the hill,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And sped across the late-forsaken field</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To where, with shattered sword and splintered shield,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Among the mounded bodies Geoffrey lay.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She loosed his helm, but deathly pale and still</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>His young face gleamed within the light of day.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine beside him knelt, as Philip sought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A draught of water from the peat-born stream;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When, in his eyes, at last, a fitful gleam</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flickered, and bending low, with straining ears,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The laboured breathing of her name she caught;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And over his dead face fell fast her tears.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Once more towards them the tide of battle swept;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Christine moved not. Young Philip on her cried,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And strove, in vain, to draw her safe aside.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A random shaft in her unshielded breast--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though hot to stay its course her brother leapt--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Struck quivering, and she slowly sank to rest.</span>

      <div class="line">
        <span>Queen Hild sat weaving in her garden-close,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>When on her startled ear there fell the news</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of Christine's flight before the darkling dews</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Had thrilled with dawn. A strand of golden thread</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Slipped from her trembling fingers as she rose</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And hastened to the castle with drooped head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>All morn she paced within her blinded room,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unresting, to and fro, her white hands clenched;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>All morn within her tearless eyes, unquenched,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Blue fires of anger smouldered, yet no moan</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Escaped her lips. Without, in summer bloom,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The garden murmured with bliss-burdened drone</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of hover-flies and lily-charmed bees;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sometimes a finch lit on the window-ledge,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With shrilly pipe, or, from the rose-hung hedge,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A blackbird fluted; yet she neither heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Nor heeded aught; until, by rich degrees,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Drowsed into noon the noise of bee and bird.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yea, even when, without her chamber, stayed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A doubtful step, and timid fingers knocked,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She answered not, but, swiftly striding, locked</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yet more secure, with angry-clicking key,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The bolted door, and the affrighted maid</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unto the waiting hall fled, fearfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Wearied at last, upon her bed Queen Hild</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In fitful slumber sank; but evil dreams</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Of battle-stricken lands and blood-red streams</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Swirled through her brain. Then, suddenly, she woke,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Wide-eyed, and sat upright, with body chilled,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though in her throat the hot air seemed to choke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Swiftly she rose; then, binding her loosed hair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She bathed her throbbing brows, and, cold and calm,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Downstairs she glided, while the evening-psalm</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In maiden-voices quavered, faint and sweet,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And from the chapel-tower, through quivering air,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The bell's clear silver-tinkling clove the heat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She strode into the hall where yet the King</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sat with his knights; a weary minstrel stirred</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Cool, throbbing wood-notes, throated like a bird,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From his soft-stringèd lute. With scornful eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Hild looked on them and spake: "Can nothing sting</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Your slumberous hearts from slothful peace to rise?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Must only stripling-knights and maidens ride</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To battle, where, unceasing, foemen wage</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>War on your marches, and your wardens rage</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In impotent despair with desperate swords,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>While you, O King, with sheathèd arms abide?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She paused, and, wondering, the King and lords</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Looked on her mutely; then, again, she spake:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"Shall I, then, and my maidens sally forth</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>With battle-brands to conquer the wild north?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Yea, I will go! Who follows after me?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>As by a blow struck suddenly awake,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The King leapt up, and, like a clamorous sea,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The knights about him. Scornfully the Queen</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Looked on them: "So my woman's words have roused</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The hands that slumbered and the hearts that drowsed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Make ready then for battle; ere seven days</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Have passed, the dawn must light your armour's sheen,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And in the sun your pennoned lances blaze."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Her voice ceased; and a pulsing flame of light</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Flashed through the hall; in crashing thunder broke</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The heavy, hanging heat; the rafters woke</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In echo as the rainy torrent poured;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Bright gleamed the rapid lightning; yet more bright</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The war-lust kindled hot in every lord.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>To clang of armour the seventh morning stirred</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>From slumber; restless hoof and champing bit</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Aroused the garth; and day, arising, lit</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A hundred lances, as, each bolt withdrawn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The courtyard-gate swung wide with noise far-heard,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And flickering pennons rode into the dawn--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Before his knights, the King, and at his side,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Queen Hild, with ever-northward-gazing eyes;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>But, ere they far had fared, in mute surprise</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They stayed and all drew rein, as down the road</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They saw a little band of warriors ride--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sore travel-stained--who bore a heavy load</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Upon a branch-hung litter; while before</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Came Philip, bearing a war-broken lance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Though King and lords looked, wondering, in a glance</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Queen Hild had read the sorrow of his face</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And pierced the leaf-hid secret--which e'ermore</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>A brand of fire upon her heart would trace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Darkness about her swirled, but, with a fierce</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Wild, conquering shudder, shaking herself free,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Unto the light she clung, though like a sea</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>It surged and eddied round her; yet so still</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She sat, none knew her steely eyes could pierce</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>The leafy screen. With guilty terror chill,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>She heard the king speak--sadly riding forth:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>"Whence come you, Philip, battle-stained and slow?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>What burden bear you with such brows of woe?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Then Philip answered, mournfully: "I bring</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Two wanderers home from out the perilous north.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Prepare to gaze on death's defeat, O King."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>They lowered the litter slowly to the ground;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Back fell the branches; in the light of day,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>In calm, white sleep Christine and Geoffrey lay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>And at their feet the baleful Helm of Strife</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        <span>Sword-cloven. Hushed stood all the knights around,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
